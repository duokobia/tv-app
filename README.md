Tv-app is a responsive NextJS web application that is designed primarily to showcase my frontend skills in create beautiful and responsive user interfaces to potential employers.

# What it does

The features implemented in this app includes: ... It is a dynamic web application that is responsive to different devices view ports. API endpoints were fetched using axios library. The app was implemented using a TDD approach. At first, the app was built using Client Side Rendering. It was later modified to Server Side Rendering.

An improvement on this version of the application will be to use typescript instead of javascript in order to catch most potential errors at compile time.

# Frameworks and Libraries used

The following frameworks were used for faster development of the web application:

- NextJs
- React-router-dom v6
- Axios
- BootStrap5
- Jest/Enzyme

# Challenges I faced

This app was built at my leisure time. So I had no deadline to meet while delivering this app. Hence the reason it took me this long to complete its implementation.

# How to install and run the web application locally on your machine

To run the app locally, please follow the steps below:

1. Git clone the repository on your terminal:
   git clone https://github.com/duokobia/tv-app.git

2. cd tv-app

3. npm install

4. npm run dev

That is it! The application should run on your development server on http://localhost:3000.
